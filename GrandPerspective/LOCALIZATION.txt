  GrandPerspective Localization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Localized versions have been provided for earlier versions of
GrandPerspective for which I am grateful. In particular, the following
localizations exist:

  * Japanese, by Chris Li
  * Spanish, by Javier Alfonso
  * French, by Maxime Hadjinlian
  * German, by Helge Baumann

Unfortunately, the app has evolved and these localizations are not up
to date anymore. Furthermore, Apple has changed the mechanism used to
internationalize applications. GrandPerspective has been adapted to
support this, which means that additional effort is required to adapt
the existing localizations.

So I am looking for volunteers who can update the existing
localizations or who are willing to provide new ones. You can do so for
any language you speak fluently. You can post a message on the
GrandPerspective localization forum to express your interest:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/grandperspectiv/discussion/634668/

We can then take it from there.

Thanks again to everyone who has been providing localizations for
GrandPerspective so far.

Cheers,
Erwin Bonsma
